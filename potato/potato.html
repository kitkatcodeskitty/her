                        You don’t have to take all these letters seriously. Okay? It’s just me and my stupid things. You have a certain charm that appeals to me. The star cradles your face, drags its thumb across your lips the most bewitching way possible, and when the stars align, you somehow make it brighter.  I find great delight in constellation you rouse. Thank you for painting my life with colors I never knew existed. You mean so much to me And I know it’s too soon for me to say such a big words to us are you might think I am just saying things to please u or it’s just a sweet talk but No I really mean all of it. Before u I was all just existing like I didn’t used to feel excited for coming days or for future. But after I don’t know about others things but I looks forward to talk with you play with you and all. You make me happy and all. But we are so far right like really far I don’t know how will I make it to you but I will do my best for it. So, until then I want to have keep dreaming about you. Where it is you and I, one where love existed between the both of us and not simply from the infatuation of it. And in that dream, I would love to waking up beside you and basking in the presence of you. In that dream, I belong to you, just like you belong to me. Uh I didn’t know I was such a romantic person.
                        <br> 
                        And I’ll admit it, you’re my be all or end all, I smile when I see notification from you, I constantly miss you whenever you’re not around, I am addicted to you as you know, and sometime I feel that I might be overwhelming you with all my habits and all, so sorry my motive was never to overwhelm you or will be. And I have come to realize that I am not an easy person like when I love I love so get so much attached that it become unhealthy obsession. My mood depends on how u treat me. I constantly overthink if I notice some change in conversation. But it’s my things so don’t worry I will try to change all about myself that makes u uncomfortable and am not saying this to get pity or sympathy no never (uh my brain thinks from so many perspective). Just saying that u can tell me when u feel I am doing something stupid or when I am doing something that affect you. You can tell me I won’t be angry and I never have been angry on you. So, you can tell me when u don’t want to talk to me. You can tell me when you are mad at me or when I am wrong. Just communicate with me! 
                        <br>
                        And yeah, you are pretty more than u think. I know I have said to u so many times and I’m saying it again it’s because you are pretty. U don’t need to be insecure. I love everything that is related to you. Your voice, personality, nose, hair and all. You are perfect as you are. But if u want to change something about you that’s your personal preference. Pat Pat. I love you more than u think. And I don’t want to bored u with my stupid ahh shit and sorry if I wrote something bad triggers You. And If u don’t find this pretty sorry again because I lack creativity Hehe. But I tried my best even though it’s exam times. With much love! Take care!
