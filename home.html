                Uhh I know we recently get together and it's too soon for us to tell how we will end up but i really want you to be with me together. Like i really really want us to be together. I don't wanan break up with you. Because love every little things about you.You know it too I was not looking for any relationship for so long i would have still be single if u had never ask me to be your boyfriend. It was so out of the blue when you ask me to be your boyfriend. I was confused and not sure after it that time. Maybe i was scared from past but im happy i accept to be ur boyfriend. We were always kind and we were good to eachother even before we were together so that give me confidient i guess.
                And now i am totally obessed with you like uhh how should i tell you. I love when we play games, chat for whole night, watch movies together i feel so happy around you even though u are not physically here.I love how confident u sound on our calls, your small giggle, and like all the rambles u make it is cute and make me fall for u more.And when u say mwahh and i have to reply even though am shy ahaha i remember I didn't used to do when we were new but now i do i guess even though i sound shy.It cause i never used to do smth like that before I was not expressive ig but It's cute,you are cute and we are cute if u agree. I love your nose so much that the first thing i will be doing is to pinch you when we meet  and you changli like hair and cheeks I really wanna squeeze them so bad.
                I love it when you share your things with me tell me about your day. And am sorry again if i sound stupid rn cuz like it's 3am and im writing this. I just want to finish this quickly so that i can show it to my baby hehe. I try making something cute that you will like it but i lack creativity so sorry about it! 
                I love you!
